Just a simple mortgage calculator using Flexbox and JavaScript.

# App 1 of 30
So today I started the #30appschallenge. My first app was a simple loan/mortgage calculator. I've been doing more reading than coding lately and wanted to refresh myself on the basics. 

# What I learned:
Refresher on HTML forms
Review on DOM manipulation
Review of Flexbox

# Things to add on: 
Recreate in React or Vue
Option to search by zipcode and find lenders
Integrate credit score into helping determine interest rate

I was inspired by a lovely shot on Dribbble by Ellen Yang:https://dribbble.com/shots/5645683-Payment-calculator-UI
